# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Comprehensive Testing, Coverage, and CI/CD Enablement

This PRD defines the executable plan for Task Master to orchestrate the testing and CI/CD work. It mirrors and operationalizes the goals captured in `docs/TASK_MASTER.md` and `docs/TESTING_PRD.md`.

## Goals and Success Criteria
- 100% unit test coverage across backend services and controllers
- 100% integration test coverage for system interactions
- Performance benchmarks established and tracked
- CI/CD pipeline executes tests and reports on every commit
- Zero ESLint and TypeScript errors in main

## Global Deliverables
- `test-reports/` with JUnit, HTML, and JSON summaries
- `coverage/` with v8 provider outputs (text, HTML, JSON)
- GitHub Actions workflow file for CI execution

## Phases

    status: todo
    type: file_update
    paths:
      - "README.md"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Badges rendered at top of README"

## Risks and Blockers
- Typeahead system: case sensitivity and debouncing issues
- Web crawler system: content extraction and filtering problems

## Start Here (for Task Master)
1. Queue tasks in this order respecting dependencies: UTS-001 → UTS-002 → INT-001 → PERF-001 → CI-001 → CI-002.
2. Execute command-type tasks in a non-interactive shell from the repo root.
3. Persist artifacts to paths listed in each task.
4. Mark tasks as done when acceptance criteria are satisfied.
